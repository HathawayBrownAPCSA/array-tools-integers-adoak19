Good start - not quite right yet.
getMax and getMin work great.
The Index methods, not quite yet.
You correctly compare each string to max (or min) - but you don't update max (or min) when you find a new max (or min).
You'll want to either (1) include a second line in the if statement (don't forget { braces } ) or 
  (2) compare to arrayData[pos] instead of max (or min).
  
Score now, 8/10
Max (not min) 9/10 when corrected.
