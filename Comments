Looks very good and clean!  
All straight-forward and direct code.  Except for one weird thing:
  the getMaxIndex method returns one less than the correct index.
Remember that you are starting at zero, and stopping when you get the index up to arrayCount,
  so the -1 is already accounted for.
(You did it correctly in getMinIndex).

Question is: did you find the error while testing?

Fix this and re-post.  8/10 for now, +1 when corrected.
