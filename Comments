Good formatting and good use of JavaDoc comments.

Your getMin and getMax methods work just fine.

The index methods, not so much!
There are two problems.  
  #1, getMaxIndex inappropriately subtracts 1 from the final answer.  
      pos should keep track of the actual location, so the 0 .. length-1 is already accounted for.
      getMinIndex gets this right.
  #2, neither function is updating pos correctly.  You ALWAYS set it to i,
      instead of only setting it to i if you have found a new max/min.
      You need { braces } and it looks like you skipped them.
      
And the biggest question of all:
  Why didn't you find this when you were testing the program?

Fix this and re-post.  6/10 for now, +2 when corrected.
Thanks.


Jan. 26 - much better now!
